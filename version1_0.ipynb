If Executive terminates this Agreement or his employment with the Company for Good Reason or if Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company for any reason other than for Cause, including non-renewal of this Agreement by the Company, and such termination occurs during a Change of Control Period, the Company shall pay to Executive a change of control indemnity of: (i) the Severance Indemnity as defined in Section 3.2; and (ii) a lump-sum payment equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the higher of: (A) the greater of (x) Executive’s target bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which the Change of Control occurs or (y) Executive’s target bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which Executive’s termination of employment occurs; or (B) Executive’s actual bonus for performance during the calendar year prior to the calendar year during which the termination of employment occurs. For avoidance of doubt, the amount paid to Executive pursuant to this Section 3.3 will not be prorated based on the actual amount of time Executive is employed by the Company during the fiscal year (or the relevant performance period if something different than a fiscal year) during which this termination occurs; and (iii) one hundred percent (100%) of Executive’s outstanding and unvested Option Shares will become vested in full. Notwithstanding any other provision in any applicable equity compensation plan and/or individual stock option plan or agreement, Executive’s outstanding and vested stock options as of the Executive’s termination of employment date will remain exercisable until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the termination of employment date; provided, however, that the post-termination exercise period for any individual stock option right will not extend beyond its original maximum term of the original date of the grant.

For purposes of this subsection (ii), if any Person is considered to be in effective control of the Company, the acquisition of additional control of the Company by the same Person will not be considered a Change of Control; or (iii) A change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company’s assets which occurs on the date that any Person acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12) month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than fifty percent (50%) of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions.\n",

The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator who is a member of the AAA, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. The arbitrators shall have jurisdiction to determine any claim, including the arbitrability of any claim, submitted to them. The arbitrators may grant any relief authorized by law for any properly established claim. The interpretation and enforceability of this paragraph of this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9. U.S.C. § 1, et seq. More specifically, the parties agree to submit to binding arbitration any claims for unpaid wages or benefits, or for alleged discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, Sections 1981 through 1988 of Title 42 of the United States Code, COBRA, the New York State Human Rights Law, the New York City Human Rights Law, and any other federal, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance, and any common law claims, claims for breach of contract, or claims for declaratory relief. The Executive acknowledges that the purpose and effect of this paragraph is solely to elect private arbitration in lieu of any judicial proceeding he might otherwise have available to him in the event of an employment-related dispute between him and the Company. Therefore, the Executive hereby waives his right to have any such employment-related dispute heard by a court or jury, as the case may be, and agrees that his exclusive procedure to redress any employment-related claims will be arbitration.\n",

Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, if an optionee's employment or service with the Company terminates for any reason other than because of total disability or death as provided in Sections 6(a)(iv)(B) and (C), his or her option may be exercised at any time before the expiration date of the option or the expiration of three months after the date of termination, whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to the extent the optionee was entitled to exercise the option at the date of termination.    (B) Termination Because of Total Disability. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, if an optionee's employment or service with the Company terminates because of total disability, his or her option may be exercised at any time before the expiration date of the option or before the date 12 months after the date of termination, whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to the extent the optionee was entitled to exercise the option at the date of termination. The term \"total disability\" means a medically determinable mental or physical impairment that is expected to result in death or has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of 12 months or more and that, in the opinion of the Company and two independent physicians, causes the optionee to be unable to perform his or her duties as an employee, director, officer or consultant of the Employer and unable to be engaged in any substantial gainful activity. Total disability shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day after the two independent physicians have furnished their written opinion of total disability to the Company and the Company has reached an opinion of total disability.    (C)  Termination Because of Death. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, if an optionee dies while employed by or providing service to the Company, his or her option may be exercised at any time before the expiration date of the option or before the date 12 months after the date of death, whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to the extent the optionee was entitled to exercise the option at the date of death and only by the person or persons to whom the optionee's rights under the option shall pass by the optionee's will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of domicile at the time of death.    (D)  Amendment of Exercise Period Applicable to Termination. The Board of Directors may at any time extend the three month and 12-month exercise periods any length of time not longer than the original expiration date of the option. The Board of Directors may at any time increase the portion of an option that is exercisable, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Board of Directors.    (E) Failure to Exercise Option. To the extent that the option of any deceased optionee or any optionee whose employment or service terminates is not exercised within the applicable period, all further rights to purchase shares pursuant to the option shall cease and terminate.    (F)  Leave of Absence. Absence on leave approved by the Employer or on account of illness or disability shall not be deemed a termination or interruption of employment or service. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, vesting of options shall continue during a medical, family, military or other leave of absence, whether paid or unpaid.    (G) Change of Control. In the event an optionee's employment by the Company or by any parent or subsidiary of the Company terminates within one year after a change in control of the Company for any reason other than retirement, death, or total disability (as defined in Section 6(a)(iv)(B)), any option held by such optionee may be exercised with respect to all remaining shares subject thereto, free of any limitation on the number of shares with respect to which the option may be exercised in any one year, at any time\n",
