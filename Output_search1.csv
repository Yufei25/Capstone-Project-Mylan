Introduction
It is possible that the Company may from time to time receive acquisition proposals by other entities. The Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the Company (the Committee) recognizes that consideration of any such proposals can be a distraction to employees and can cause the employees to consider alternative employment opportunities. The Committee has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the participants in the Plan (the Participants), notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.
The Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide each Participant with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Participants to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
The Committee believes that it is imperative to provide the Participants with certain benefits upon the Participants termination of employment following a Change of Control. These benefits will provide the Participants with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control."
