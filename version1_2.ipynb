In order to induce Linda V Moore (“Executive”) to remain employed by Merix in the face of uncertainties about the long-term strategies of Merix and possible change of control of Merix and their potential impact on Executive’s position with Merix, this Agreement, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of Merix, sets forth the severance benefits that Merix will provide to Executive in the event Executive’s employment by Merix is terminated under the circumstances described in this Agreement.

In making the proration calculation, the amount of Executive’s award if Executive had been a participant for the full incentive period shall be divided by the total number of days in the incentive period, and the result multiplied by the actual number of days Executive participated in the plan. The payment amount shall be calculated at the end of the incentive period and the amount shall not be due and payable by Merix to Executive until the date that all awards are payable to other eligible employees after the close of the incentive period, except that Executive may elect at any time after Termination of Executive’s Employment, by written notice to Merix, to receive 50 percent of Executive’s target benefit instead of the prorated amount, in which case the payment shall be made within 20 days of such election. If the applicable plan provides for a greater payment for a participant whose employment terminates prior to the end of an incentive period, the applicable plan payment shall be made.
