Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to him a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership of the Employers Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board called for such purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board, he was guilty of conduct that constitutes Cause (as defined above) and specifying the conduct in detail.(iii) Disability. For purposes of this Agreement, Disability shall mean a medically diagnosed physical or mental impairment that may be expected to result in death, or to be of long, continued duration, and that renders Executive incapable of performing the essential duties required under this Agreement even with reasonable accommodation.

Good Reason will only be deemed to occur if, within ninety (90) days after a material reduction or change described above first occurs, the Executive provides notice to the Employer of the existence of Good Reason and of the Executives intended termination of employment due to Good Reason, and the Employer does not remove Good Reason condition within ninety (90) days after receiving such notice from the Executive. The Executives written notice must explain the basis on which the Executive believes Good Reason exists, the cure period, and the date on which the Executive intends to terminate employment, which must be no later than six (6) months after the existence of the Good Reason.

The reduction shall be in an amount so that the present value of the total amount received by the Executive from the Employer or its affiliates and subsidiaries will be 2.99 times the Executives base amount (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and so that no portion of the amounts received by the Executive shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (excise tax). Insofar as permitted by the Code, Employer shall reduce those elements of the severance pay package specified by the Executive, provided, however, that Employer will not reduce the SERP credits provided for in Section 5(b)(II). The determination as to whether any reduction in the severance payment is necessary shall be made by the Employer in good faith, and the determination shall be conclusive and binding on Executive. If through error or otherwise Executive should receive payments under this Plan, together with other payments the Executive has the right to receive from the Employer, in excess of 2.99 times his base amount Executive shall immediately repay the excess to Employer upon notification that an overpayment has been made.7.

Non-Disparagement.Executive will not, during the Term or after the termination or expiration of this Agreement or Executives employment, make disparaging statements, in any form, about Employers officers, directors, agents, employees, products or services which Executive knows, or has reason to believe, are false or misleading.11. Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate.a.In the event of a dispute or claim between Executive and Employer related to Employees employment or termination of employment, all such disputes or claims will be resolved exclusively by confidential arbitration in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). This means that the parties agree to waive their rights to have such disputes or claims decided in court by a jury. Instead, such disputes or claims will be resolved by an impartial AAA arbitrator whose decision will be final.b.The only disputes or claims that are not subject to arbitration are any claims by Executive for workers compensation or unemployment benefits, and any claim by Executive for benefits under an employee benefit plan that provides its own arbitration procedure. Also, Executive and Employer may seek injunctive relief in court in appropriate circumstances.c.The arbitration procedure will afford Executive and Employer the full range of statutory remedies. Employer will pay all costs that are unique to arbitration, except that the party who initiates arbitration will pay the filing fee charged by AAA. Executive and Employer shall be entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their claims, including access to essential documents and witnesses, as determined by the arbitrator and subject to limited judicial review.

All other provisions and any partially enforceable provisions shall remain unaffected and shall remain in full force and effect.d.In the event of any claim or dispute arising out of this Agreement, the party that substantially prevails shall be entitled to reimbursement of all expenses incurred in connection with such claim or dispute, including, without limitation, attorneys fees and other professional fees. This paragraph shall apply to expenses incurred with or without suit, and in any judicial, arbitration or administrative proceedings, including all appeals therefrom.e.Any notice required to be given under this Agreement to either party shall be given by personal service or by depositing a copy of such notice in the United States registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the following address, or such other address as addressee shall designate in writing:Employer:3111 C StreetAnchorage, AK 99503Executive:4127 Raspberry RoadAnchorage, AK 99502f.This Agreement shall in all respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, be governed by and construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Alaska.g.This Agreement is intended to comply and shall be interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, including any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.
