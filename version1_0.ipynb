Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to him a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership of the Employer’s Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board called for such purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board, he was guilty of conduct that constitutes Cause (as defined above) and specifying the conduct in detail.\n",

Good Reason shall include, but not be limited to: (A) a material reduction in Executive’s compensation defined as a reduction equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of Executive’s then annual base salary, (B) a material reduction in Executive’s duties and responsibilities, but not merely a change in title, or (C) relocation of Executive’s primary workplace by more than fifty (50) miles. “Good Reason” will only be deemed to occur if, within ninety (90) days after a material reduction or change described above first occurs, the Executive provides notice to the Employer of the existence of Good Reason and of the Executive’s intended termination of employment due to Good Reason, and the Employer does not remove Good Reason condition within ninety (90) days after receiving such notice from the Executive. The Executive’s written notice must explain the basis on which the Executive believes Good Reason exists, the cure period, and the date on which the Executive intends to terminate employment, which must be no later than six (6) months after the existence of the Good Reason. The provisions of Section 5(f)(iv) are intended to comply with the Good Reason safe harbor provisions of Code Section 409A and applicable regulations.\n",

The Executive shall not have a Separation from Service while on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as the Executive retains a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or contract.

For purposes of the foregoing, Executive will be deemed to be connected with such business if the business is carried on by: (i) a partnership in which Executive is a general or limited partner; or (ii) a corporation of which Executive is a shareholder (other than a shareholder owning less than 5% of the total outstanding shares of the corporation), officer, director, employee or consultant, whether paid or unpaid.\n",

If Executive terminates this Agreement or his employment with the Company for Good Reason or if Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company for any reason other than for Cause, including non-renewal of this Agreement by the Company, and such termination occurs during a Change of Control Period, the Company shall pay to Executive a change of control indemnity of: (i) the Severance Indemnity as defined in Section 3.2; and (ii) a lump-sum payment equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the higher of: (A) the greater of (x) Executive’s target bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which the Change of Control occurs or (y) Executive’s target bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which Executive’s termination of employment occurs; or (B) Executive’s actual bonus for performance during the calendar year prior to the calendar year during which the termination of employment occurs. For avoidance of doubt, the amount paid to Executive pursuant to this Section 3.3 will not be prorated based on the actual amount of time Executive is employed by the Company during the fiscal year (or the relevant performance period if something different than a fiscal year) during which this termination occurs; and (iii) one hundred percent (100%) of Executive’s outstanding and unvested Option Shares will become vested in full. Notwithstanding any other provision in any applicable equity compensation plan and/or individual stock option plan or agreement, Executive’s outstanding and vested stock options as of the Executive’s termination of employment date will remain exercisable until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the termination of employment date; provided, however, that the post-termination exercise period for any individual stock option right will not extend beyond its original maximum term of the original date of the grant. All payments set forth in this Section 3.3 (i), (ii) and (iii) defined as (the “Change of Control Indemnity”).\n",

The arbitration shall be held in Basehor, Kansas. The arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the AAA in effect at the time the claim or dispute arose, unless other rules are agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator who is a member of the AAA, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. The arbitrators shall have jurisdiction to determine any claim, including the arbitrability of any claim, submitted to them. The arbitrators may grant any relief authorized by law for any properly established claim. The interpretation and enforceability of this paragraph of this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9. U.S.C. § 1, et seq. More specifically, the parties agree to submit to binding arbitration any claims for unpaid wages or benefits, or for alleged discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, Sections 1981 through 1988 of Title 42 of the United States Code, COBRA, the New York State Human Rights Law, the New York City Human Rights Law, and any other federal, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance, and any common law claims, claims for breach of contract, or claims for declaratory relief. The Executive acknowledges that the purpose and effect of this paragraph is solely to elect private arbitration in lieu of any judicial proceeding he might otherwise have available to him in the event of an employment-related dispute between him and the Company. Therefore, the Executive hereby waives his right to have any such employment-related dispute heard by a court or jury, as the case may be, and agrees that his exclusive procedure to redress any employment-related claims will be arbitration.\n",
