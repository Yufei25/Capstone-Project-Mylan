Test File 10.docx,date,Heading,"LIBOR Interest Period means the period commencing on the date a Loan bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate is made, continued, or converted and continuing overnight, with successive periods commencing daily thereafter.

LIBOR Margin means two and three quarters percent percent (2.75%) per annum.

LIBOR Rate means the average rate per annum calculated by Lender in good faith, which Lender determines with reference to the rate per annum (rounded upwards to the next higher whole multiple of 1/16th if such rate is not such a multiple) as shown in Reuters at which deposits in United States dollars are offered by prime banks in the London interbank eurodollar market two LIBOR Business Days prior to the day on which such rate is calculated by Lender, in an amount approximately equal to the amount of such advance and with a maturity equal to the applicable LIBOR Interest Period. In the event that the LIBOR Rate is determined to be less than zero, such LIBOR Rate shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Note. If Reuters no longer reports such rate or Lender determines in good faith that the rate so reported no longer accurately reflects the rate available to Lender in the London Interbank Market, Lender may select a replacement index, but under no circumstances shall the LIBOR Rate be less than zero percent (0%).

Prime Rate means the rate per annum from time to time established by Lender as Lenders Prime Rate, whether or not such rate is publicly announced. The Prime Rate may not be the lowest interest rate charged by Lender for commercial or other extensions of credit. In the event of any change in the Prime Rate, the rate of interest applicable to Borrowers Loans evidenced hereby shall be adjusted to immediately correspond with each such change.

Reserve Percentage means for any LIBOR Interest Period, the maximum reserve percentage which is specified by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) or any other governmental or quasi-governmental authority with jurisdiction over Lender for determining the maximum reserve requirement (including, but not limited to, any basic, supplemental, special, marginal, or emergency reserve requirement) for Lender with respect to liabilities or assets constituting or including (among other liabilities) Eurocurrency liabilities (as defined in Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) in an amount equal to that of the advances affected by such LIBOR Interest Period and with a maturity equal to the LIBOR Interest Period.

(b) Borrower may exercise the LIBOR Rate Option by giving Lender irrevocable written notice of such exercise on the second LIBOR Business Day prior to the proposed commencement of the relevant LIBOR Interest Period. The Loan will bear interest at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for consecutive LIBOR Interest Periods until a different election is made. Borrower may only request advances bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate in amounts equal to or in excess of $100,000.00 unless otherwise agreed by Lender.

(c) If, because of the introduction of or any change in, or because of any judicial, administrative or other governmental interpretation of, any law or regulation, there shall be any increase in the cost to Lender of making, funding, maintaining, or allocating capital to any advance bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, including a change in the Reserve Percentage, then Borrower shall, from time to time upon demand by Lender, pay to Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate Lender for such increased cost, and the determination by Lender shall be conclusive absent obvious error and shall be payable by Borrower to Lender upon Lenders demand.

(d) If Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower, absent manifest error) that (i) dollar deposits in an amount approximately equal to the portion of the advances for which Borrower has exercised the LIBOR Rate Option for the designated LIBOR Interest Period are not generally available at such time in the London Interbank Market for deposits in dollars, (ii) the rate at which such deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lender of maintaining an Adjusted LIBOR Rate on such portion of the advances or of funding the same for such LIBOR Interest Period due to circumstances affecting the London Interbank Market generally, (iii) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining an Adjusted LIBOR Rate, or (iv) an Adjusted LIBOR Rate would be in excess of the maximum interest rate which Borrower may by law pay, then, in any such event, Lender shall so notify Borrower and all portions of the advances bearing interest at an Adjusted LIBOR Rate that are so affected shall, as of the date of such notification with respect to any event described in item (ii) or (iv) above, or as of the expiration of the applicable LIBOR Interest Period with respect to an event described in item (i) or (iii) above, bear interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate until such time as the situations described herein are no longer in effect.

(e) If, because of the introduction of or any change in, or because of any judicial, administrative or other governmental interpretation of, any law or regulation, it becomes unlawful for Lender to make, fund, or maintain any Loan at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, then (i) Lender shall notify Borrower that Lender is no longer able to maintain the interest rate at an Adjusted LIBOR Rate, (ii) the LIBOR Rate Option shall immediately terminate, and (iii) the interest rate for any portion of the Loans for which the interest rate is then an Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall automatically be converted to the Adjusted Prime Rate. Thereafter, all advances under this Note shall bear interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate until such time as the situation described herein is no longer in effect.

(f) All computations of interest and unpaid fees shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and paid for the actual number of days of each year elapsed; that is, by multiplying the outstanding principal balance by the applicable interest rate, dividing by 360 days, and multiplying by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. This method of computation results in a higher interest yield to Lender than if a 365-day year were used.

(g) If pursuant to the terms of this Note, Borrower is at any time obligated to pay interest on the principal balance of this Note at a rate in excess of the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law, the applicable interest rate shall be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all previous payments in excess of the maximum rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due hereunder and Borrower and any guarantor shall not have any action against Lender for any damages arising out of the payment or collection of excess interest or charges.


(h) Lender shall not be required to notify Borrower of any adjustment in the LIBOR Rate; however, Borrower may request a quote of the prevailing LIBOR Rate on any Business Day."
