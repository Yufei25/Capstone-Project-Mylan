In the event Executive’s employment is terminated during calendar year 2016 in connection with (a) the sale of the Company to a third-party purchaser or group of third-party purchasers acting as a single consortium (the “Purchaser”); or (b) an asset sale or change in the composition of the Board consistent with the change of control definition contained in IRC 409A or the regulations thereof ((a) and (b) collectively, a “Change of Control”), Executive shall receive the 2015 Guaranteed Award to the extent unpaid, and a payment equivalent to 200% of Executives fixed pay. For the purposes of this Section 4(b), “fixed pay” shall mean the sum total of the Base Salary and Role Based Allowance amounts described in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) above, such amounts to be used for the determination of the payments due under 4(b) whether or not Role Based Allowance is still in effect generally. All unvested equity-based or deferred cash awards, including without limitation those granted as part of the “Buy-Out” shall vest on the normal schedule in accordance with applicable plan rules and award agreements. The payments are contingent upon Executive executing, and not revoking, a Standard Release. Any payment pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be in lieu of, not in addition to, any separation payment Executive may otherwise have been eligible for pursuant to Section 4(a) above or any Company policy or practice with respect to separation from employment which may be in effect from time to time. For avoidance of doubt, a sale of Company stock to the public through an IPO or further sell-down of Company stock to the public shall not trigger this Section 4(b). Effective January 1, 2017, this Section 4(b) becomes null and void by its own terms with immediate effect.\n",
