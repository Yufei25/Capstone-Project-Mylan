The reduction shall be in an amount so that the present value of the total amount received by the Executive from the Employer or its affiliates and subsidiaries will be 2.99 times the Executive’s base amount (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and so that no portion of the amounts received by the Executive shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (excise tax).
